# Contributing to Drum Root

## First steps

- Fork [drum-root](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/drum-root) (and [drum-root-api](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/drum-root-api))
- Add your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/drum-root/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) file
- Commit your changes and create a pull request (through your forked repository)
- Once your PR is approved and merged you are officially a contributor! You can then begin to look for tasks to do in our Trello boards. To gain access to these boards, request an invitation in our Discord channel.
- Note: Just like your first contribution, you will continue to create new pull requests through your forked repository.

### When contributing to this repository, check the Trello board for available tasks.

`To gain access to the Trello boards please request access through our dedicated Discord channel`

### If the task is:

- **Available**: Go ahead and _claim the task_. You can assign it to yourself by editing your name into the card and moving it into the `Doing` column.
- **Claimed**: If someone else has claimed the task, speak with them or one of the project admin.
- **In Code Review**: You should move your task into the `Code Review` column after you have created a Pull Request for the task. Keep checking your Pull Request in case a team member asks for some changes to be made.
- **Non-Existant**: If the feature does not appear on trello, _discuss it on Discord or speak with a project admin_. This is to ensure, everyone has the chance to get involved without wasting their time or rushing to add the feature.
